        "summary": "The article discusses the impact of climate change on property and casualty (P&C) insurance. While insurers have a better grasp of climate risk compared to other sectors, they still underestimate secondary perils. The industry faces pressure from investors, regulators, and society to address climate risks as some premium and profit pools become vulnerable. A lack of response could harm the industry's reputation, with climate risk potentially causing market failures. Increased catastrophic events and regulatory demands pose threats to business models, affecting insurability and affordability of risks.",
